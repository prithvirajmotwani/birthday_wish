  `Nisha, My Love,

The first time I looked at you, I felt something I had never experienced before — a feeling that made me happy, crazy, and restless all at once. It was love — pure, wild, and consuming. Some call it madness, others call it luck. But I call myself the luckiest man alive because I get to experience this feeling with you.`,
  `The day we got engaged was the happiest day of my life — because that day, I got you, the love of my life. Even though at that time it was still one-sided, I believed in my love. I knew, one day, it would reach your heart.`,
  `I still remember your soft “Hello, Namaste” when we talked for the first time on Masi’s phone — just a day after our engagement. Those two simple words gave me an adrenaline rush, the kind you’d only get from a drug.`,
  `It’s funny when I think about it now — I was in the middle of a haircut when Anu Masi called. I rushed outside to talk to you, making the barber wait for ten minutes. He was annoyed, but I didn’t care — because I had just heard your voice for the first time.`,
  `This love has made me do things you might find silly. Long before we even started talking, I used to look at your pictures under the blanket at night, talking to your eyes, admiring your beauty, smiling from my heart, feeling grateful… and eventually falling asleep looking at your photos.`,
  `I still remember that first text from you — just a simple “Hi” from a UK number, with your profile picture. My heart raced like never before; it felt like it was about to burst out of my chest. I quickly ended the family call I was on and replied immediately. Since then, I used to look at your profile picture again and again — and every single time, I felt that same rush, that same spark in my heart. That’s why I’ve always had a special feeling attached to that picture — it reminds me of the exact moment my heart truly fell for you.`,
  `After those first few texts and our first call — which felt more like an interview where I asked all the questions and you simply answered — I realized you were different from anyone else. I knew you were a hard nut to crack, and it would take time for you to open up. But deep down, I was just happy — because I got a girl like you.`,
  `When I first confessed my feelings to you, I was over the moon. I spent the entire day rereading our messages, smiling, thinking about you, and feeling like the luckiest person alive.`,
  `When our eyes met for the first time at my home, I had to stop and calm myself before continuing work — my heart was racing uncontrollably.

And the first time we met in person — you walking towards me with that beautiful smile, your hair swaying gently in the air — I was trying so hard to hold my nervousness. When we finally shook hands (the first time I ever touched you), I can still feel that moment — that touch — on my right hand.`,
  `After that meeting, things didn’t go perfectly, though I still cherished every second I spent with you. I made mistakes I never thought I would, but every moment with you was worth it.`,
  `Our journey together has been a rollercoaster — thrilling, emotional, full of laughter and love. Every time you flirted, showed your affection, or were simply your lovely, playful self, I felt butterflies.`,
  `I still remember the day you first kissed me (Lip emoji) — I was so flattered, so excited, that I wanted to kiss you back with all my heart. But since emojis couldn’t express how deeply I felt, I just kept sending more and more — still not enough to match the intensity of my love in that moment.`,
  `Since the day we got engaged, I haven’t stopped thinking about you — not even for a single second. You are always on my mind.`,
  `I miss you — every single day, every single moment.
I miss doing the little things couples do.
I miss talking to you all the time.
I miss seeing you.
I miss holding your hand, looking into your eyes, hugging you tight when I feel low, and simply being around you.`,
  `Sometimes I miss you so much that my heart starts beating faster, and I can’t focus on anything else. I just lie down, look at our chats and your pictures, and imagine us together.`,
  `From the day of our engagement till today, I’ve loved you with all my mind, heart, and soul.

I love you so much, Nisha, that I want to give you everything I have — every bit of my love, my time, and my heart. I want to keep proving my love for you, again and again, in every way possible.`,
  `Remember this always:

If you’re upset with me, I’ll still love you.
If I’m mad at you, I’ll still love you.
If you’re mad at me, I’ll still love you.
If we argue, I’ll still love you.
If we disagree, I’ll still love you.

Because my love for you is unconditional. I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.`,
  `You can call it madness, craziness, or obsession — but this is my love for you, Nisha.
My pure, honest, and eternal love.

Forever yours,
Raj ❤️`,
